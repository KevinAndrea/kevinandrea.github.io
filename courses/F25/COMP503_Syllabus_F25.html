<!--[ZEUS]------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div id=zeus class=main>
  <h2>Computer Accounts</h2>
  <p>This is a <b>Systems Programming</b> class.  Unlike a general-purpose C courses for any computer system, this course is based on building programs for a specific system.  For COMP 503, that system is an emulated server that is running Zeus. </p>

  <p>Zeus is a Linux computer running Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is administerd by the College of Engineering and Computing for our use.  Some of our programs will involve libraries that have been pre-built on Zeus, and some programs will use system specific features that may only build properly on Zeus.</p>

  <h3>Connecting to Zeus</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Instructions for Zeus and for setting up the VPN: <a href="https://labs.vse.gmu.edu/index.php/Systems/Zeus">https://labs.vse.gmu.edu/index.php/Systems/Zeus</a> </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Zeus Policies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>All Programming Assignments must Compile and Run on Zeus</b> </li>
    <li> All Programming Assignments will be Tested and Graded only on Zeus.</li>
    <ul>
      <li> You may develop wherever and using whichever tools you like. </li>
      <li> You will need to ensure your work builds and runs on Zeus before submission. </li>
      <li> A programming assignment that will not compile on Zeus cannot be graded. </li>
      <li> Remember, C has certain guarantees and others that are only 'system dependent'. It still needs to run properly on Zeus to be graded. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> You will need to set up the Campus VPN to access Zeus from off-campus. </li>

<!--[HONOR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<div id=honor class=main>
  <h2>Academic Standards (Honor Code)</h2>

  <p>Academic Standards exist to promote authentic scholarship, support the institution’s goal of maintaining high standards of academic excellence, and encourage continued ethical behavior of faculty and students to cultivate an educational community which values integrity and produces graduates who carry this commitment forward into professional practice.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As members of the George Mason University community, we are committed to fostering an environment of trust, respect, and scholarly excellence. Our academic standards are the foundation of this commitment, guiding our behavior and interactions within this academic community. The practices for implementing these standards adapt to modern practices, disciplinary contexts, and technological advancements. Our standards are embodied in our courses, policies, and scholarship, and are upheld in the following principles:&nbsp;</p>

  <ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><strong>Honesty:&nbsp;</strong>Providing accurate information in all academic endeavors, including communications, assignments, and examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  
    <li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong>&nbsp;Giving proper credit for all contributions to one’s work. This involves the use of accurate citations and references for any ideas, words, or materials created by others in the style appropriate to the discipline. It also includes acknowledging shared authorship in group projects, co-authored pieces, and project reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

    <li><strong>Uniqueness of Work:</strong>&nbsp;Ensuring that all submitted work is the result of one’s own effort and is original, including free from self-plagiarism. This principle extends to written assignments, code, presentations, exams, and all other forms of academic work.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Violations of these standards—including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication, and cheating—are taken seriously and will be addressed in accordance with university policies. The process for reporting, investigating, and adjudicating violations is <a href="https://academicstandards.gmu.edu/">outlined in the university’s procedures</a>. Consequences of violations may include academic sanctions, disciplinary actions, and other measures necessary to uphold the integrity of our academic community.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The principles outlined in these academic standards reflect our collective commitment to upholding the highest standards of honesty, acknowledgement, and uniqueness of work. By adhering to these principles, we ensure the continued excellence and integrity of George Mason University’s academic community.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Student responsibility:&nbsp;</strong>Students are responsible for understanding how these general expectations regarding academic standards apply to each course, assignment, or exam they participate in; students should ask their instructor for clarification on any aspect that is not clear to them<em>.</em></p>

  <p>We take the honor code quite seriously. Any attempts at copying or sharing code, algorithms, or other violations of the honor code simply will not be tolerated.</p>

  <p>As seductively simple as it may seem to just copy and paste work from a friend or online source, remember that it is just as easy to compare your work electronically, and discover the similarities. We use automated software to flag suspicious cases, and then review them by hand to find the cases that must be submitted to the Academic Standards Office. Repeat to yourself: it's not worth trying to cheat. We will catch it, and sadly but surely, we will turn it in.</p>

  <p><b>The penalty for cheating will always be far worse than a zero grade, to ensure it's not worth taking the chance.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The usual Sanction applied is Level 2 (Failure in the course).</b></li>
    <li>It's a pretty sure-fire way to lose a semester and lose some implicated friends; please don't put yourself through that experience!</li>

  <h2>Sexual Harassment and Interpersonal Violence Policies</h2>

  <p>As a part of George Mason University’s commitment to providing a safe and non-discriminatory learning, living, and working environment for all members of the University community, the University does not discriminate on the basis of sex or gender in any of its education or employment programs and activities. Accordingly,&nbsp;<strong>all&nbsp;non-confidential employees, including your faculty member, have a legal requirement to report to the Title IX Coordinator, all relevant details obtained directly or indirectly about any incident of Prohibited Conduct</strong>&nbsp;(such as sexual harassment, sexual assault, gender-based stalking, dating/domestic violence). Upon notifying the Title IX Coordinator of possible Prohibited Conduct, the Title IX Coordinator will assess the report and determine if outreach is required. If outreach is required, the individual the report is about (the “Complainant”) will receive a communication, likely in the form of an email, offering that person the option to meet with a representative of the Title IX office.</p>

  <p>For more information about non-confidential employees, resources, and Prohibited Conduct, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/sexual-harassment-policy/">University Policy 1202</a>: Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct and Other Forms of Interpersonal Violence. Questions regarding Title IX can be directed to the Title IX Coordinator via email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:TitleIX@gmu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TitleIX@gmu.edu</a>, by phone at 703-993-8730, or in person on the Fairfax campus in Aquia 373.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Student opportunity</strong>: &nbsp;If you prefer to speak to someone&nbsp;<strong><em>confidentially</em></strong>, please contact one of Mason’s confidential employees in Student Support and Advocacy (<a href="https://ssac.gmu.edu/">SSAC</a>), Counseling and Psychological Services (<a href="https://caps.gmu.edu/">CAPS</a>), Student Health Services (<a href="https://shs.gmu.edu/">SHS</a>), and/or the&nbsp;<a href="https://ombuds.gmu.edu/">Office of the University Ombudsperson</a>.</p>
